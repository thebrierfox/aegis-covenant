# Aegis Covenant Dissemination Strategy

## Context

The **Aegis Covenant** is a proposed operational framework for AI systems that places *mercy‑first alignment* at its core.  It emphasises inclusion over exclusion, minimal‑sufficient and reversible actions, accountability through artefacts and logs, and a decision loop grounded in human values.  To have maximum impact, this covenant should not remain a private manifesto; it should be presented to organisations and communities that are already shaping AI ethics and governance.  The aim is to get feedback, encourage adoption and incorporate the covenant into broader ethical frameworks.

## Rationale for dissemination

Many respected bodies have already established principles for responsible AI, but they are still looking for actionable practices.  For example, UNESCO’s **Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence** – the first global standard on AI ethics – calls for transparency, fairness and human oversight and identifies multiple policy action areas【423755377289350†L503-L518】.  It also highlights the need for multi‑stakeholder collaboration to turn high‑level values into practice【423755377289350†L559-L617】.  UNESCO’s *Business Council for Ethics of AI* brings together companies to share experiences and promote ethical practices【423755377289350†L674-L690】.  Similarly, the **AIES 2025** conference invites papers on governance, regulation, moral decision making and ethical models/frameworks【719464195300330†L116-L150】.  These examples show that there is appetite for practical ethical frameworks and spaces to share them.

## Proposed dissemination channels

### 1. **Submit to AI ethics conferences and journals**

- **AIES (AI, Ethics and Society) Conference** – The 2025 call for papers specifically welcomes work on governance, regulation and control, value alignment and ethical models/frameworks around AI【719464195300330†L116-L150】.  Preparing a scholarly paper summarising the covenant’s philosophy, decision loop and metrics would allow it to be peer‑reviewed and presented to a multidisciplinary audience.  Even if accepted only as a poster, the conference will expose the covenant to ethicists, technologists and policymakers.
- **IEEE/ACM and similar journals** – Journals focusing on AI ethics or standards (e.g. *AI and Ethics* or IEEE’s *Computer* special issues) often solicit practical frameworks and case studies.  Submitting the covenant as a case study of operationalised ethics would position it alongside other standards like IEEE 7000.
- **Special issues & calls** – There are open calls for chapters on ethical AI (e.g., IGI Global’s call on “Ethical AI Applications”) and special issues on AI standards.  Tailoring the covenant to these calls could lead to publication in edited volumes.

### 2. **Partner with organisations advancing ethical AI**

- **UNESCO Business Council for Ethics of AI** – The council brings together companies to exchange experiences and develop ethical practices【423755377289350†L674-L690】.  Membership is currently open to companies; partnering with a member organisation or proposing the covenant as a case study could lead to recognition under UNESCO’s recommendation.  Telstra’s recent membership emphasises that companies join to support policy development, develop ethical impact assessment tools and ensure AI serves the public good【536748136982670†L93-L126】.  Aligning the covenant with UNESCO’s principles and presenting it to the council could fast‑track adoption in Latin America and beyond.
- **Partnership on AI (PAI)** – PAI hosts working groups on inclusive research, human connection and AI safety, and its resource library includes frameworks for safe foundation model deployment.  It convenes companies, academia and civil society【893092266019713†L216-L219】.  Approaching PAI with the covenant could yield a collaborative project to operationalise mercy‑first alignment or integrate elements into their guidance for safe foundation model deployment.
- **Open Ethics Initiative** – An inclusive, open data movement for AI self‑disclosure, it provides tools like the Open Ethics Maturity Model and encourages contributions from members.  By joining the initiative, contributors can have their work acknowledged and published【455656531629805†L23-L39】.  Membership involves contributing research or code and helps shape a safer digital space【455656531629805†L23-L39】.  Submitting the covenant and working with their community could produce an “Open Ethics Label” or transparency protocol aligned with mercy‑first alignment.

### 3. **Share through open‑source platforms**

- **GitHub/Open‑source repositories** – Uploading the covenant manifest, policy JSON and preamble to a public repository under an open licence (e.g. CC BY‑SA) will make it easy for developers and organisations to fork, adapt and contribute.  Popular AI ethics repositories (e.g., “awesome‑ai‑ethics”) compile frameworks, research papers and guidelines; adding the covenant with a short description will help discoverability.
- **Open Ethics’ GitHub** – The Open Ethics Initiative has a GitHub presence and encourages contributions【455656531629805†L23-L39】.  Opening a pull request to include the covenant in their taxonomy or as an example of a transparency protocol could ensure integration into existing ethical tools.

### 4. **Engage with standards bodies and policy makers**

- **IEEE Standards Association** – The IEEE 7000‑2021 standard addresses ethical concerns in system design and invites contributions to working groups.  The covenant’s focus on reversible, human‑centric decisions could complement future revisions or working group discussions.
- **ISO/IEC 42001 & NIST AI RMF** – These standards offer management processes and risk management frameworks.  Publishing a white paper that maps how the mercy‑first alignment decision loop complements risk functions (govern, map, measure, manage) could lead to citations in guidance documents.  The global AI governance article summarises these frameworks【132782881396712†L24-L45】, illustrating that organisations value harmonisation and cross‑framework alignment.
- **OECD & UNESCO committees** – Both organisations run consultations and readiness assessments.  Submitting the covenant to these consultations or volunteering for working groups (e.g., UNESCO’s Women4Ethical AI platform) will integrate it into policy discussions.  UNESCO emphasises that its recommendation’s principles need practical methodologies and welcomes resources to help member states implement them【423755377289350†L620-L626】.

### 5. **Public and industry outreach**

- **Blog posts and op‑eds** – Write a concise, compelling article on the covenant’s goals and how it complements existing standards.  Publish it on the user’s company website, Medium, Substack or LinkedIn.  Cross‑link to the covenant repository and invite feedback.  Many executives learn about new frameworks through industry blogs.
- **Workshops & webinars** – Host or join webinars on AI ethics with partners like the Open Ethics Initiative or local AI ethics groups.  Present the covenant and discuss real‑world scenarios.  These interactive sessions provide feedback and foster adoption.
- **Community forums** – Share the covenant with communities such as the AI Alignment Forum, Effective Altruism groups focusing on AI safety, and the AI Now Institute.  Seek constructive critique and contributions.

## Action steps

1. **Publish** the covenant (manifest, policy JSON and preamble) on a publicly accessible GitHub repository under an open licence.
2. **Draft a conference paper** that positions the covenant within existing AI ethics literature and submit it to AIES 2025 or a similar venue【719464195300330†L116-L150】.
3. **Reach out to organisations**:
   - Contact the UNESCO Business Council for Ethics of AI to explore membership or partnership, referencing their goals of ethical AI deployment【423755377289350†L674-L690】 and the fact that companies are actively joining to contribute to policy development【536748136982670†L93-L126】.
   - Apply for membership in the Open Ethics Initiative and share the covenant through their projects【455656531629805†L23-L39】.
   - Approach the Partnership on AI to propose adding the covenant to their resource library and working groups.
4. **Engage with standards bodies** by volunteering for IEEE or ISO working groups or submitting comments during public consultation periods; map the covenant’s decision loop against existing risk management functions (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001).
5. **Write a public article and host webinars** to introduce the covenant to broader audiences and gather feedback from developers, academics and policymakers.

## Conclusion

The Aegis Covenant is poised to influence how AI systems are governed and aligned with human values.  To achieve meaningful change, it must be integrated into ongoing conversations in AI ethics and governance.  By submitting it to scholarly venues, partnering with initiatives like UNESCO’s Business Council and the Open Ethics Initiative, publishing it openly and engaging with standards bodies, the covenant can evolve through feedback and help shape the next generation of responsible AI.
