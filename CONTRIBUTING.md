# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Aegis Covenant project! We welcome contributions that help improve this framework and its implementation.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug Reports:** If you find a bug or something doesn't work as expected, please [open an issue](../../issues/new) and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce and the expected vs actual behaviour.
- **Feature Requests:** If you have an idea to improve the covenant, [open an issue](../../issues/new) describing the problem you're trying to solve and your proposed solution.
- **Pull Requests:** If you want to implement a fix or a feature, please discuss it first in an issue or in a [GitHub Discussion](../../discussions). This helps us ensure your work aligns with the project's direction and minimises duplication of effort.

- Keep your changes focused. One pull request should address a single concern.
